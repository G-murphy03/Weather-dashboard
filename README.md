# Weather-dashboard
Sixth week of the Sydney University coding bootcamp, this challenge consisted of developing a weather dashboard using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Within this challenge, we were required to use specific skills learnt in the past week. This included utilising server side APIs through fetching data to display on our website.

## Acceptance-Criteria
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- WHEN I view the UV index
- THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
